# Differential equations

Problem (polar destroyer):
```
(ds/dt)^2 	=	 (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2
		= 	r^2 (dθ/dt)^2 + (dr/dt)^2
(√3/ t) dt 	= 	d θ
(√3 ln t) + c= 	θ 
√3 ln (⅕) + c	 = 	0
c		 = 	-√3 ln (⅕)

θ(t)		 =  	(√3 ln t)  - √3 ln (⅕)
recall: r/15 = t

θ(r) 		= 	 (√3 ln r/15)  - √3 ln (⅕)
θ(r) 		= 	√3 ln (r/3)
r		= 	3e^(θ/√3)
```

Time:
```
max θ = 2 π
max t of curve = ⅕(e^(2π/√3)) 
upper bound of T):  ⅕(e^(2π/√3))  + ⅕ 
```

Logarithmic spiral has many special properties:
Self-similarity (i.e. zooming out makes rotation of itself)
Turnings of a logarithmic spiral increase in geometric progression
Constant angle between an intersecting circle centred at the origin and a logarithmic spiral

Particularly, these properties imply that when you increase the radius (ex. circle), there will be a constant angle of rotation no matter what size the circle is.

Same pattern as hawks circling to catch prey, or hurricane!
